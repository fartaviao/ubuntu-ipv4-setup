1. Prerequisites

Software and Hardware:
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 or later.
Permissions: Root user privileges or access via sudo.
Static or Dynamic IP Address: Ensure the desired IP configuration is pre-determined.

Required Tools:
SSH connection to the server (if remote).
Basic text editors like nano or vim for optional manual adjustments.

Cloning the Project:
To access the necessary documentation and script, clone the GitHub repository:
git clone https://github.com/fartaviao/ubuntu-network-config.git

3. Configuring the Network

(1) Update the System

Ensure your system is updated before running the script:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

(2) Run the Script

Run the 0-netplan-configurator.sh script to set up the network:
chmod +x 0-netplan-configurator.sh
sudo ./0-netplan-configurator.sh

Script Highlights:
Interactive Configuration: Choose the interface you want to configure and choose between static or DHCP during runtime.
Static IP Details: Input the IP address, gateway, and DNS servers interactively.
Validation Logs: All actions are logged in /var/log/netplan-config.log.

---------------------------------

4. Validation and Testing

(1) Check Current Configuration

Use the following command to confirm the applied settings:
ip addr show <interface_name>

(2) Test Connectivity

For DHCP: Verify if the server obtained an IP dynamically.
For Static IP and DHCP: Test connectivity to the gateway and external resources:
ping -c2 <gateway_ip>
ping -c2 8.8.8.8
ping -c2 google.com

(3) Review Logs

Check /var/log/netplan-config.log for a detailed log of operations performed by the script:
cat /var/log/netplan-config.log
